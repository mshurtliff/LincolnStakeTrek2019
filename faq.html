    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>    

    <h2>When is the 2019 Lincoln Stake Trek?</h2>
    
    The Trek will be from June 17th to June 19th (Monday through Wednesday).   We will meet at the Lincoln Stake Center at ??? am.
    
    <h2>Which forms and releases do I need to fill out or return in order to go?</h2>
    
    You should make sure you are registered.  If you are under 18 years of age and you will not be assigned to a family with your parent or guardian, you must fill out the medical release form.
    
    <h2>What is the age group for the Trek?</h2>
    
    The Trek is for all individuals who wish to participate from the Lincoln Stake.  Youth younger than 11 must have a parent or guardian travel with them.  Accomodations will be made for those that are not able to walk long distances or do not wish to participate in hiking trek.
    
    <h2>Who are the leaders of each family or group?</h2>
    
    Each family organized will decide on one or two leaders of that family.  The stake will assign families to handcart companies lead by a trail boss.  The Trail boss will communicate to the family leaders.
    
    <h2>What is a "Trek Family"?</h2>
     
    A Pioneer family is considered an individual, a group of friends, a family, or a group of more than one families wishing to travel together.  This can include YM groups, YW groups, or Youth groups.  Each Pioneer Family has one or two individuals that are considered the leaders of that family.
    
    <h2>How do I get a pioneer name and story assigned?</h2>
    
    If you have an ancestor that was part of one of the hand cart companies or wagon trains (Martin, Willie, Hunt, Hodgetts or Rescue Company) you may represent that ancestor on Trek and be prepared to share their story with your trek family.
    <br /><br />
    For those that do not have an ancestor that was part of these particular pioneer groups listed above (which will be the majority), the Stake YW/YM Presidencies will be assigning names and pioneer stories to you previous to the Trek. 
    
    <h2>How do I get started finding pioneer clothing?</h2>
    
    To familiarize you with what pioneer's wore in the 1850's refer to the Youth Packet or to the individual Clothing lists for Young Men or Young Women.  Both documents can be found on www.lincolnstaketrek2019.org
    <br /><br />
    Sister Melissa Poulson from the Manhattan 2nd ward has been asked to be the 2019 Lincoln Trek clothing committee.  She is a great resource for information on how to get started and what qualifies as pioneer clothing.  Please contact her for questions or guidance her phone number is 530-277-5404.  
    
    <h2>It the stake paying for each youth's pioneer clothing?</h2>  
    
    Unfortunately not.  Each individual family should provide their youth with the necessary clothing.  If you have a situation of a family that just cannot afford this expense, please see your bishop/branch president about providing funds for that youth's clothing.
    
    <h2>Can the youth bring friends on the trek?</h2>  
    
    Unfortunately not.  We love when friends join us for all activities, but this activity is a little different.  There is very limited bus space.
