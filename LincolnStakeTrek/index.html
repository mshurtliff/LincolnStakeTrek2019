                            One of the primary spiritual underpinnings for many of the early Pioneer Saints was to immigrate to Zion as soon as possible so they could be sealed to their families and make covenants in the Temple, the House of the Lord. The 1,300 mile trek by handcart was only a portion of their journey; it was the covenants they had made and the covenants they hoped to make that gave them the motivation and drive to push towards Zion.

                        Joseph and Emily Wall, two siblings who were emigrating on their own, did so with the blessing of their parents. Joseph was 17 and Emily 16 when they left England, the oldest of nine children. Because the family could not afford to emigrate together, Joseph and Emily were sent ahead, and the rest of the family hoped to follow soon afterward.
